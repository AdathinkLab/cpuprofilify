usage: cat trace.txt | cpuprofilify <options> > my.cpuprofile 

  Converts the given trace taking according to the given opttions


OPTIONS:

--unresolveds  , --nounresolveds    unresolved addresses like `0x1a23c` are filtered from the trace unless this flag is set (default: false)
--sysinternals , --nosysinternals   sysinternals like `__lib_c_start...` are filtered from the trace unless this flag is set (default: false)
--v8internals  , --nov8internals    v8internals like `v8::internal::...` are filtered from the trace unless this flag is set (default: false)
--v8gc         , --nov8gc           when v8internals are filtered, garbage collection info is as well unless this flag set  (default: true)

--shortStack      , --noshortStack        stacks that have only one line are ignored unless this flag is set (default: false)
--optimizationinfo, --nooptimizationinfo  JS optimization info is removed unless this flag is set (default: false)


--type                              type of input `perf|dtrace`. If not supplied it will be detected. 
--help                              print this help

EXAMPLE:

  Generate cpuprofile from DTrace data with default options 
  using higher switchrate in order to deal with large amount of data being emitted

    sudo profile_1ms.d -c <command> | cpuprofilify > out.cpuprofile

  Generate cpuprofile from DTrace data with default options keeping v8 internals

    sudo profile_1ms.d -c <command> | cpuprofilify --v8internals > out.cpuprofile

  Generate cpuprofile from DTrace data with default options filtering v8 gc events
    
    sudo profile_1ms.d -c <command> | cpuprofilify --nov8gc > out.cpuprofile
